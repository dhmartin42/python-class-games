# python-class-games
This is a rewrite of my MOOC python games class using python. each game is in a different directory, and the file orig_game.py has the original code of the game using the classes simplegui package to control the game functions. The games that need it will use the arcade library. Also, for the spaceship and ricerocks games, I will be using 
different sprites, as this was a request of the course instructors. 

Statuses of games: 
    Blackjack:
        Original game in folder
        Incomplete
    Guess the Number: This originally used a gui, and output to the console. I went/am going (depending on when you read this) on the remaster.
